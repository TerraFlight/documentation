# Embeddings
_An embedding is a mapping of a discrete — categorical — variable to a vector of continuous numbers._

Neural network embeddings have 3 primary purposes:

1.  Finding nearest neighbors in the embedding space. These can be used to make recommendations based on user interests or cluster categories.
2.  As input to a machine learning model for a supervised task.
3.  For visualization of concepts and relations between categories.

Neural network embeddings overcome the two limitations of a common method for representing categorical variables: One-Hot Encoding.
